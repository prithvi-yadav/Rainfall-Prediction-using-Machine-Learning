# Rain Prediction Using Logistic Regression and Real-Time Weather Data

This project uses a Logistic Regression machine learning model to predict **whether it will rain** in a given city, based on **real-time weather data**. The model is trained on historical weather observations and uses features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover.

---

## Features

- Trained logistic regression model with 98%+ accuracy  
- Real-time weather data using OpenWeatherMap API  
- Encoded city and weather conditions  
- Predicts rain and shows probability (%)  
- Trained on Aprilâ€“June 2024 Maharashtra weather data

## Dataset Overview

**File**: `shuffled_weather_data.csv`  
**Cities**: Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Bhayander, Mahabaleshwar  
**Total Records**: ~450 (April â€“ June 2024)

### Key Features:
- `temp` â€“ Temperature (Â°C)  
- `humidity` â€“ Humidity (%)  
- `windgust`, `windspeed` â€“ Wind speeds (m/s)  
- `sealevelpressure` â€“ Air pressure (hPa)  
- `cloudcover` â€“ Cloud coverage (%)  
- `conditions` â€“ Text description (e.g., Clear, Rain)  
- `city`, `city_encoded`, `conditions_encoded` â€“ Encoded inputs  
- `will_rain` â€“ Target (1 = Rain, 0 = No Rain)

---

## Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression  
- **Framework**: scikit-learn  
- **Accuracy**: ~98.1% on test data  
- **Target**: `will_rain` (binary classification)

## Real-Time Rain Prediction

### Example:

```
Location: (lat , long) @ 2025-06-30 18:45 IST  
Input to Model: [27.62, 81, 10.97, 8.2, 1005, 100, 1, 1]  
Probability of rain (Logistic Regression): 6.06%
```

### How it works:
1. Fetches current weather using OpenWeatherMap API
2. Encodes city and conditions
3. Feeds data to trained ML model
4. Prints rain prediction & probability

## How to Run

1. **Install requirements**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the real-time prediction script**
```bash
python real_time_prediction.py
```

3. *(Optional)* Retrain the model using the notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook model_training.ipynb
```
